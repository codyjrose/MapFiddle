Mapstrap
=========


[Mapstrap](http://Mapstrap.com/) was created to assist developers by providing much of the boilerplate code needed to create a web map. As well as providing working documentation for often used map features.

It can be used to build web maps using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js or Google Maps.
